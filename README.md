# Simple-Python-Honeypot

This is a super simple honeypot written in python. 

Created by: Eric Lemire

This python script can be deployed on any system running Python. We recommand deploying to a Linux Server OS.

Note: This is a basic example and should not be used in a production environment without further enhancements, security measures, and legal considerations. This honeypot does not actually have a running service, thus it is unable to actually accept connections or receive data.

Feel free to utilize this script as a starting point for your own honeypot!

Happy Hunting!
